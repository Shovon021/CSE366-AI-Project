🌿 Cotton Leaf Disease Detection using Pre-trained CNN
This project utilizes a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to automatically detect and classify diseases in cotton plant leaves. By leveraging transfer learning, the model achieves high accuracy with limited data and computational resources.

📌 Features
Built using transfer learning with pre-trained CNN architectures (e.g., VGG16, ResNet).

Classifies cotton leaves into categories: Healthy, Diseased, etc.

Easy to train and test with minimal setup.

Visualizations for performance analysis and predictions.

🧠 Model Overview
Pre-trained Model: Utilizes models like VGG16 or ResNet50 for feature extraction.

Dataset: Cotton leaf images labeled into healthy and disease categories.

Training: Fine-tuned the last few layers for cotton leaf classification.

Evaluation: Confusion matrix, accuracy/loss graphs, classification reports.
